/**
 * The Cyrix Healthcare lockup — the real artwork, not a drawing of it.
 *
 * Every module used to approximate this wordmark in its own SVG, which is
 * how one company came to have four that were nearly but not quite alike.
 * This is the supplied file, shipped as-is, so there is nothing left to
 * drift.
 *
 * Two files rather than one: the artwork is black type on a transparent
 * ground and would vanish on a dark page. The dark-page copy is the same
 * image with its *lightness* inverted and hue left alone — a plain invert
 * would turn the red cyan and the blue orange, which is another company's
 * logo. Both are in the markup and CSS picks one, so the swap happens in
 * the same frame as the theme and never flashes the wrong one.
 *
 * The lockup is three stacked bands, and the shorter ones are a crop of
 * the same file rather than separate exports — `.cyrix-logo` clips, so
 * asking for less shows less of one image.
